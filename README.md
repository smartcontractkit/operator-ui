# Operator UI

This package is responsible for rendering the UI of the chainlink node, which allows interactions wtih node jobs, jobs runs, configuration and any other related tasks.

## Setup

The GQL schema that lives within `smartcontractkit/chainlink` is used to generate client typings for this repo. See below for a list of options for generating these bindings, either based on a local chainlink repo copy, or remotely off of github.

```sh
# Assuming that your chainlink repo lives in ../chainlink (relative to this git repo root)
yarn setup

# If you have your chainlink repo in a different directory
REPO_PATH="$HOME/src/smartcontractkit/chainlink" yarn setup

# If you want to fetch the schema files from github instead, from the develop branch
# Note that you need to supply $GH_TOKEN, this is a PAT that needs read access to the
# smartcontractkit/chainlink repo.
GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN yarn setup

# If you want a different branch than develop on the smartcontractkit/chainlink repo
GH_TOKEN=$GH_TOKEN REPO_REF="feature/gql_changes" yarn setup
```

## Running Chainlink Node

Assuming you already have a local chainlink node listening on port 6688, run:

```
CHAINLINK_BASEURL=http://localhost:6688 yarn start
```

Now navigate to http://localhost:3000.

If sign-in doesn't work, check your network console, it's probably a CORS issue. You may need to run your chainlink node with `ALLOW_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000` set.

## Contributing

### Versioning

If your PR creates changes to the operator-ui itself, rather than tests, pipeline changes, etc. Then please create a changeset so that a new release is created, and the changelog is updated. See: https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md#what-is-a-changeset

### If your PR contains GQL Schema Changes

If your work also involves a modified schema, that means that you have a linked PR open in the `smartcontractkit/chainlink` repo. The way the status checks are setup in both repositories means that there are the following schema enforcements:

#### Chainlink

- A schema change must never be a breaking change

#### Operator UI

- All PR's have their schema's referenced against the `develop` branch of `smartcontractkit/chainlink`

Given these constraints, the workflow would look like the following:

1. Make changes to the schema, using `yarn setup` to use the local schema to test your changes
2. After the schema changes are satisfactory, and the resolver changes are implemented, open a PR for these changes in `smartcontractkit/chainlink`
3. Open a PR for the frontend changes that use the modified schema in `smartcontractkit/operator-ui`, CI should fail since the schema changes in #2 have not been merged to develop yet.
4. Merge the PR created in #2
5. CI should now pass for the PR created in #3
6. Merge in the PR created in #3
7. An automated pull requested would have been created within `smartcontractkit/chainlink` to update to the just-released version of Operator UI.
8. Merge the aforementioned PR in.
